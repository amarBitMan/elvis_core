[Paraphrasing @aboroskaâ€¦](https://github.com/inaka/elvis_core/issues/149#issuecomment-699679362):
The custom of adding an `author` attribute came from Ericsson with the intention to help
operations/testers to call/notify the right developers when a crash happened.
It's not used anymore.

> Works on `.beam` file? Yes!
